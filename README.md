# Waterpump predictive maintenance based on sensor data
## Context / Business Problem
The dataset comes from sensors of a water pump that had 7 fails in a year.
Our aim is to predict those fails thanks to historical data
## Developing environment
- Pandas : 1.2.4
- Numpy : 1.20.1
- Matplotlib : 3.3.4
- Seaborn : 0.11.1
## Dataset
The dataset used is available here : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anseldsouza/water-pump-rul-predictive-maintenance/metadata
The dataset includes :
- The timestamps
- 52 measures from the sensors
- The RUL (Remaining Useful Life) in hours : Length of time before an equipment is going to function before failing
## Demo
